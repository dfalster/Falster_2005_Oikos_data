(2005) Tradeoffs between height growth rate, stem persistence and maximum height among plant species in a post-fire succession. Oikos, 111, 57â€“66. DOI: 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13383.xThese data were collected, compiled and analysed by Daniel Falster.The data were deposited in dryad 8 years after publication of the article. While I have endeavoured to check the details of the archive, there may be some small differences to the published paper, due to the time delay between publishing and data release.Full details regarding the study and methods used are available in the publication. In summaryStudy site: he study was conducted in low-open sclerophyll forest situated in Myall Lakes National Park in south eastern Australia. Annual precipitation is moderate (1352 mm, 105 year average), with some rain in all months. Mean annual temperature is 178C. The park contains a diversity of vegetation structural types delimited by substrate variation arising from past and present dune formation. We restricted our study to a large section of the park situated on a relatively homogeneous substrate of freely draining Holocene sands.Study design: Fire is a recurrent disturbance in the park. Patches of vegetation 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 27 and 28 years since fire were identified and plants within were sampled to reconstruct species height-growth trajectories over time. Where possible several patches within a given age class were surveyed to determine species presence or absence. Nineteen species recorded in a majority of patches were selected for further study. This included eight resprouting species and 11 obligate seeders. For each species, we recorded height and diameter at 10% of height for the five tallest individuals found in each patch and age class. The presence of reproductive material on each individual was also noted. Initial surveys were conducted between 20th September and 10th October 2002. The three youngest sites were resampled in March 2003 to give additional intervals of 'time since fire'. Samples were collected for measurement of leaf, stem and architectural traits.Six data files have been provided. These include1. appendix1-species_means.csv: a machine readable copy of Appendix 1 from the published paper, given mean values for each of the trait measured.2. site_list.csv: details on the site used3. survey_data.csv: survey of largest individuals for each species in each patch, given height, diameter, and presence of reproductive material. This data was used to fit height growth trajectories and to estimate reproductive size threshold.4. wood.csv: individual-level samples of wood traits5. leaf.csv: individual-level samples of leaf traits6. seed.csv: source for seed mass records used in paper.In addition, each of the data files has a metadata file associated with it, which lists the variables used, units, and description for each.
